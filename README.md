<details>
<summary><b>plikan - Ez Crackme</b> | Difficulty: 1.0/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 1.0/6.0
- **Author**: plikan
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `plikan - Ez Crackme/plikan - Ez Crackme - Solution.pdf`
- **Description**: Simple .NET console crackme. I used dnSpy to inspect Main, where the program compares Console.ReadLine() directly against a hard-coded string. The correct password is stored in plaintext, so no encoding or transformation was involved.
- **Date Solved**: 2025-11-30

<summary><b>zsombii - Easy crackme</b> | Difficulty: 1.0/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 1.0/6.0
- **Author**: zsombii
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `zsombii - Easy crackme/zsombii - Easy crackme - Solution.pdf`
- **Description**: Java `.jar` crackme. Using JADX, I recovered `checkValidity()` which scores the 10-character key by counting how many characters satisfy `(ch & 3) == 0` (i.e., ASCII divisible by 4). A key is valid if the score is exactly 4. I also wrote a small Python keygen in `zsombii - Easy crackme/solution/` to generate valid keys.

<summary><b>illusionxxx - simple crackme</b> | Difficulty: 1.5/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 1.5/6.0
- **Author**: illusionxxx
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `illusionxxx - simple crackme/illusionxxx - simple crackme - Solution.pdf`
- **Description**: Used x64dbg to follow the string references and the main comparison loop, then analyzed the function that transforms user input. The crackme encodes the input with a per-byte XOR where the key is the length of the string, and compares it to the constant l?xo\r0e`. Reversing this length-based XOR yields the correct key.

<summary><b>vilxd - crack the points</b> | Difficulty: 2.0/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 2.0/6.0
- **Author**: vilxd
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `vilxd - crack the points/vilxd - crack the points - Solution.md`
- **Description**: Patch/trainer-style challenge: the program prints `Your count points is %d` with a hard-coded zeroed value. I located the call site in x64dbg/Ghidra and wrote a Python trainer that launches the process suspended, computes `moduleBase + RVA`, and patches the code to load a user-chosen value into `EDX` before the `printf` call. To make the patch robust, I used a trampoline and an allocated code cave (`VirtualAllocEx`) instead of guessing free space in `.text`.

<summary><b>vilxd - decode me</b> | Difficulty: 2.2/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 2.2/6.0
- **Author**: vilxd
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `vilxd - decode me/vilxd - decode me - Solution.pdf`
- **Description**: Used x64dbg to analyze the main function, bypass a simple IsDebuggerPresent anti-debug check, and follow the calls that read, encode, and compare the user input. The program converts each character to a \xHH form using the format string "\\x%02X" and compares against a stored constant, revealing the correct password.
- **Date Solved**: 2025-12-01

<summary><b>Biglsim04 - puzzle</b> | Difficulty: 2.5/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 2.5/6.0
- **Author**: Biglsim04
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `Biglsim04 - puzzle/Biglsim04 - puzzle - Solution.pdf`
- **Description**: Command-line crackme that hides both its console strings and password check behind a simple XOR-0x9F encoding layer. Using CFF Explorer and Detect It Easy (DIE) for static recon plus x64dbg breakpoints on WriteFile/ReadFile, I traced the input path to a 9-character length check and a character-by-character comparison against an XOR-decoded constant. By NOP-ing the failure branch and single-stepping the comparison loop, I recovered the cleartext password MYPASS123 and confirmed the same XOR-0x9F scheme is used to decode the “Hello World!”, “Enter password:” and “Access Granted/Denied!” strings at runtime.

<summary><b>Coder_90 - KeyGenMeV3</b> | Difficulty: 3.0/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 3.0/6.0
- **Author**: Coder_90
- **Status**: ✅ Solved
- **Solution**: See `Coder_90 - KeyGenMeV3/Coder_90 - KeyGenMeV3 - Solution.pdf`
- **Description**: My first keygen; Win32 GUI crackme with Name + Key validation. Used CFF Explorer for static analysis and x64dbg for dynamic analysis to trace the key validation algorithm. The program processes the name input through a semi-complex encoding function that uses different mixing operations for even/odd characters, involving ROL operations, XOR, and addition with constants. Reversed the algorithm and implemented a Python keygen that generates valid keys for any given name.

<summary><b>NemesisX - GuessPassword</b> | Difficulty: 3.5/6.0</summary>

- **Difficulty**: 3.5/6.0
- **Author**: NemesisX
- **Status**: 🔍 Analyzed
- **Solution**: See `NemesisX - GuessPassword/NemesisX - GuessPassword - Solution.md`
- **Description**: Python-based crackme packaged with PyInstaller. Used x64dbg for initial analysis and identified it as a Python executable. Extracted the Python bytecode using pyinstxtractor, then decompiled the `.pyc` file using decompyle3 to recover the source code. The program uses bcrypt (cost factor 12) to hash and validate passwords, storing the hash `$2b$12$pBRbErJA/R.oPinWBAx4buejz59JCDiARNr07zSRrK/1F8jHpMzSm`. Since bcrypt is a one-way hash, implemented a multi-threaded Python bruteforce script with timing, logging, and resume capabilities to attempt password recovery from wordlists. Reverse engineering complete; solution method implemented and running, awaiting brute force completion (limited by computational resources).
